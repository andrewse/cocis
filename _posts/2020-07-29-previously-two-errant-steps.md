As the investigators stand on the side walk, pondering their next detination, a large group of people begin to gather around chappel of contemplation. First a few, then a few dozen and before long the investigators were lost in a sea of burning torches and even the occassional pitchfork.

The investigators kept themselves poised, watching the crowd with an uneasy eye until <span class="npc"></span>**Mr. Dooley** made his way through the crowd with a Fire Marshall in tow.

> Alright folks we’ve got got Teddy here hand he’s given us the go ahead, we get get rid of this cursed place once and for all. 
> 
> &mdash; Mr. Doley

As the flames of the <span class="location"></span>**Chapel of Contemplation** streak across the eyes of the crowd, the investigators used this convenient distraction to eek their way to the back of the pressing throng. Extricating themselves and making their way to <span class="location"></span>**Corbitt House**.
